# GIS-tools

A geographic information system is a conceptualized framework that provides the ability to capture and analyse spatial and geographic data. In this repository, I am sharing my to-go tools to facilitate and automate your GIS work. 

# What you will find in this repo! 

I included ArcPy tools, which is a paid libary created by ESRI. These are essentially ArcGIS (ESRI) tools in python. 
I will also add open-source tools.
